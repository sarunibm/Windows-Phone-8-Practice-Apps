# Don't Get Too Excited...

This was my attempt at learnig how to create simple drag and drop Windows Phone Apps.
It's my very first project that I ever did and it got me excited to learn more about software development and the principals around it.

While I, unfortunately, did not pursue a career in software development, this was my first step into falling in love with tech.
After my first 6 (and terribly made Windows Phone apps), I went ahead to get my hands dirty and built two working Windows 7 apps.

One was a **wifi sharing app**, whose details you can [find on the other repository](www.github.com/sarunibm) and my most proud achievement was the creation of my own web browser
and this is the saddest story that I hold dear to my heart - I tragically lost my laptop and with it went all the code I had on the browser.
